# ScrapTweets
Introduction to scraping tweets from Twitter using Python

<h2>Scraping With Tweepy</h2>

<p>There are two parts to scraping with Tweepy because it requires Twitter developer credentials. If you already have credentials from a previous project then you can ignore this section.

<h2>Gaining Credentials for Tweepy</h2>
<p>In order to receive credentials, you must apply to become a Twitter developer <a href="https://developer.twitter.com">Here</a>. This does require that you have a Twitter account. The application will ask various questions about how you intend to use the API.
  
<p>After finishing the application, the approval process is relatively quick and shouldn’t take longer than a couple of days. Upon being approved you will need to log in and set up a dev environment in the developer dashboard and view that app’s details to retrieve your developer credentials.
  
  Make sure you have Python installed and Anaconda
  Open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda GUI
